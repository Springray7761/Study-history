    "### Bakery Order Customization and Management<br>\n",
    "Imagine you are helping \"Sweet Tooth Bakery,\" a charming local bakery known for its delicious cakes, bread, and cookies. They have a simple system: Customers can order a certain quantity of each item, and occasionally, they need to update or change their orders. Your task is to create a Python program that makes order management easy and efficient for the bakery staff, keeping in mind that the bakery deals with a limited range of products.<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Problem Tasks\n",
    "1. Taking Initial Orders\n",
    "    * Your program should be able to take the initial order from the customer, asking for the number of cakes, bread, and cookies they wish to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding Items to the Order\n",
    "    * Sometimes, customers might want to add more items to their order. You need to write a function that can add an additional item to the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Updating the Quantity of an Item\n",
    "    * If a customer changes their mind about the quantity of a particular item, your program should be able to update this in the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Identifying the Item with the Largest Quantity\n",
    "    * The bakery sometimes offers special deals on the item ordered in the largest quantity. Your program should be able to identify which item this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Extending the Order List\n",
    "    * Occasionally, customers come back to add more items to their existing order. Your program should allow for this extension, within the limit of three types of items."
