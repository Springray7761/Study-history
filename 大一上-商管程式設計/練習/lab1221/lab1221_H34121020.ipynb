    "## Process Sales Data<br>\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Your task is to write a Python function named $\\rm\\color{cyan}{process\\_sales\\_data}$ that reads sales data from a file, calculates the total quantity sold for each product, and outputs the results both on the screen and to a separate file.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "You are provided with a sales data file where each line represents a sale. Each line contains three pieces of information, separated by commas: the date of the sale, the product name, and the quantity sold.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "* Read Sales Data: Your function should read data from a provided text file named $\\rm\\color{cyan}{sales.txt}$. Each line in the file follows the format: date, product_name, quantity_sold. For example: 2023-12-01, WH-1000XM5, 3.\n",
    "* Calculate Total Sales: For each product, calculate the total quantity sold over the entire dataset.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Results\n",
    "\n",
    "* Print the total quantity sold for each product on the screen. The output should be sorted alphabetically by the product name.\n",
    "* Write these results to a new text file named $\\rm\\color{cyan}{sales\\_dec.txt}$ in the format: product_name, total_quantity. The products should be listed in alphabetical order.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "* Do not use dictionary data structures.\n",
    "* Avoid using advanced Python features such as zip, lambda, or list comprehensions.\n",
    "* Focus on using basic loops, conditional statements, and list operations.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "* Start by reading the file line by line and understand how to extract the necessary information.\n",
    "* Keep track of the total quantity sold for each product using parallel lists.\n",
    "* Sort the results before printing and writing them to the file."
